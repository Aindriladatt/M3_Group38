# INTRODUCTION:

This project is an BiCom System. This system Displays Window Status, Alarm Status, Battery Information, Door Status . There is a led signaling which helps us to identify the features. For example if we press a button 1 time all the LED will be on which means the Window status of car is displayng, similarly for 2, 3 and 4 clicks. There are several features like communication between car to key and key to car .

# REQUIREMENTS:

## HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:

System shall display Window status of the car

System shall display Alarm status of the car

System shall display Battery status of the car

System shall display Display status of the car

## LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:

According to the press of Button(1 time) all LED's shall be on or off

According to the press of Button(2 times) LED's shall be off at a time

According to the press of Button(3 times) LED's shall be on in Clockwise Manner

According to the press of Button(4 times) LED's shall be on in Anti-Clockwise Manner

# SWOT ANALYSIS:

## STRENGTHS:

This technology minimizes car theft.

There is no human interaction with the car as it is keyless.

Every function is managed by the buttons on the remote.

## WEAKNESS:

A remote can stop working because of dead battery & reprogramming of the remote can also be needed.

Two or more commands cannot be functioned at the same time.

## OPPORTUNITIES:

This system has a huge scope in automobiles as the RKE system can be programmed in such a way to handle/protect the automobiles from panics, like noise other than car theft by activating new features like alarms in it.

Enabling this system in vehicles not only improves security of car access but also facilitates convenience to the users.

Reasonable cost.

## WEAKNESS:

Introduces many threats like key fob cloning, jamming, & so on.

# 5Ws & 1H:

WHO- People who wants to control the actions of a car remotely.

WHEN- Other than controlling locks, RKE systems for cars can be used to control the security alarm, & lights.

WHY- Provides better security & actions can be controlled remotely.

WHERE- Can be used from anywhere using a remote.It maybe inside/outside a car.

WHAT- Represents the standard solution for conveniently locking & unlocking a vehicles's doors or luggage compartment by remote control.

HOW- Using a blue button with multiple LEDs.
